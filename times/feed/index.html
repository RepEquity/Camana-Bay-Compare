								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The benefits of maintaining an active lifestyle as we age seem endless. Exercise can help delay the onset of age-related decline, ward off physical and mental illness, promote general well-being and allow us to make the most of life without being continually restricted by tiredness or lack of mobility. </p>
<p>Should disease or accident takes us down, being physically fit puts us in a better position to survive and come back.</p>
<p>Sadly, studies and perceived wisdom indicate that the only fitness marker that might increase in our 40s is the body’s ability to deal with lactic acid. Every other fitness indicator, including endurance, power, flexibility, muscle mass, balance and aerobic and anaerobic capacity, will decline in varying degrees. </p>
<p>For most of us, that decline is irrelevant. Unless we were an elite athlete during our 20s, we have probably never been close to our maximum possible fitness. If we’re only at 60 per cent now, then there’s plenty of room to get closer to what’s possible even as those theoretical maximum values decline. A more relevant comparison would be our fitness this month relative to last month or last year or a decade ago. We can still improve at all sorts of activities well into our 40s and 50s and any of those fitness metrics can be nudged a little a higher than they were. </p>
<p>There are many different theories about the best ways to make fitness improvements, but most people agree that as we age, it’s a case of “use it or lose it.” The important thing is to do whatever exercise we can and move as much as we can. The absolute worst case scenario is inactivity; a sedentary lifestyle without regular exercise makes life harder and possibly shorter, too.</p>
<p>So what is the best workout, the best weekly schedule, the best bang for our exercise buck? Well-rounded fitness comes from doing a little of everything so try a variety of activities and intensities; this will also keep things interesting and help prevent injury. Ideally, include resistance training with weights, functional body-weight training, high intensity cardio and low intensity cardio with a total of four to six activities each week.</p>
<p>Whatever our chosen workouts are it’s important to remember that change comes slowly and one super hard workout is not going to be transformative. Building fitness requires patience, sustainability and repeatability. We need to push hard enough to make a difference, but not so hard that we feel like a train wreck the next day and need a few days off to recover. Honour where your fitness level is at today and work accordingly.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All club tennis players dream of having a first serve that  blasts their opponents off the court and provides them with a lot of free points.</p>
<p>A powerful first serve puts pressure on your opponents and forces them to be defensive on their return of serve, giving you a big advantage. They will often hit the ball short if they return it at all, leading to opportunities to put the ball away.</p>
<p>But the majority of club players have trouble hitting a first serve with true pace and the reason is almost always technique.</p>
<p>The most important thing to realise is that you don’t want to muscle the ball on your first serve, but use the kinetic chain in a fluid motion to create fast racquet<br />
head speed.</p>
<p>Here are key things to remember when trying to increase pace on your first serve:</p>
<p>Make sure the ball toss is just in front of you and in line with your contact shoulder so you can move into the ball at contact.</p>
<p>Make contact at full stretch — the higher the contact point the better the angle to clear the net with pace.</p>
<p>Drop the racquet behind your shoulder to increase the range of motion coming up to the ball.</p>
<p>Coil the hips and shoulders after your ball toss. Ideally, your opponent should see some of your back if you have coiled sufficiently.</p>
<p>Bend the knees as you throw the ball and then explode upwards to make contact, driving through the legs. At contact your arms and legs should be extended.</p>
<p>Maintain racquet motion after contact and follow through forward initially and then down and to the opposite side of your body. The racquet should end up pointing at the fence behind you.</p>
<p>The serve needs the legs, the core and the shoulders to all be strong and efficient to maximise power. When you are in the gym, focus on exercises like squats, planks and shoulder presses that concentrate on these three muscle groups. Also rotator cuff strengthening exercises should be done regularly, but with lighter weights. Big biceps and chests won’t give you any help with your serve.</p>
<p>The throw is almost the same motion as a serve, so increasing your throwing power and speed will have a direct correlation to your serve speed.</p>
<p>Use the kinetic change to power up your serve and take your game to another level.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s finally summer! Many Grand Cayman residents typically use this time to attempt to jump-start their health and fitness goals because of the increased sunshine, involvement in summer sports leagues and joining the kids in their various summer activities. </p>
<p>However, a lot of best-laid plans get thwarted due to stomach ailments. Exercising and eating well aren’t usually a priority when dealing with nausea, digestive upset and irritable bowels.</p>
<p>The resultant physiological effects of an out-of-balance stomach (blood sugar imbalance, low energy, etc.) can also lead to decreased mental well-being. We rely on our digestive system not only for physical, but also emotional, support. When digestion is regular, energy levels stay high and our emotional state is calm and comfortable. </p>
<p>Here are some ways to make your stomach a priority this summer:</p>
<p><strong>Eat the rainbow </strong><br />
— Visit the local farmers market and stock up on seasonal, locally sourced produce. Pick up a variety of fruits and veggies and plan your meals for the week based on what’s available. Try giving up meat for a day, or if you’re feeling ambitious, try it for a week. Your stomach will thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Stay hydrated</strong><br />
— Hydration is always important, but it’s even more important during hot summer months because we tend to sweat more due to increased ambient temperature. Replacing lost fluids is critical to prevent dehydration. Try drinking eight ounces of water first thing in the morning and then try to sip throughout the day. Also, remember that pre-exercise hydration is just as important as post-exercise hydration, especially if you plan to work out outside.</p>
<p><strong>Connect with nature</strong><br />
— This may seem odd because it doesn’t appear to directly relate to the stomach. However, all the systems in the body are interconnected so emotions such as worry and anxiety can indirectly affect your stomach and the rest of the digestive system. Summer is a great time to take an evening walk since the sun sets later. While you walk, listen to the birds singing and the wind blowing or take note of the feeling of the ground beneath your feet.<br />
 Connect to nature and allow that feeling to flow through you.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With seemingly every fad diet that makes it into mainstream recognition, another nutrition myth is born. At a lunch and learn held on 24 May for employees of PwC and Dart in Camana Bay, several of those myths were debunked by Dr. Graeme Close, head nutritionist for England Rugby and professor of human physiology at Liverpool John Moores University.</p>
<p>With findings based purely in scientific research, Close disproved many common nutrition and health myths, ranging from the optimal amount of sleep to low-carb diets.</p>
<p><strong>Myth: “It’s about carbs/fat/protein, not calories.”<br />
Truth: Calories still matter.</strong><br />
Despite many fad diets supporting a laser focus on specific nutrients, like low-carb or high-fat diets, ultimately weight maintenance will always come down to a balance of calories consumed versus calories expended.<br />
“Controlled chamber studies that we conduct time and time again show that calories still count,” Close said.</p>
<p><strong>Myth: “Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.”<br />
Truth: Breakfast is no more important than other meals.</strong><br />
This phrase was actually coined by Kellogg’s as a marketing tactic to get people to purchase and consume more cornflakes, Close said.<br />
“There is no evidence that eating breakfast kick-starts your metabolism,” he said. “You don’t wake up in the morning not metabolising — you’re not a car!” There have been numerous meta-analyses conducted on the subject of skipping breakfast and its effects on weight gain or loss, he said. The only correlation to skipping breakfast and weight gain is if people are hungry and are skipping breakfast as a way to save time, only to cave and indulge in something unhealthy later as a result.</p>
<p>“If you aren’t hungry and can get by with liquids in the morning, try starting your meals at lunch,” Close suggested, adding that for those who are hungry, a healthy meal in the morning is a good start to the day.</p>
<p><strong>Myth: “It’s my parents’ fault.”<br />
Truth: Weight control and metabolic speed are not genetic.</strong><br />
Those who argue they have a predisposition to gaining or losing weight have been proven incorrect. Close said that studies have revealed there is no genetic predisposition for weight control or metabolism speed. Instead, there is a proven predisposition when it comes to appetite hormones, which can affect weight by means of their influence on food intake based on hunger levels.</p>
<p>The two appetite hormones — ghrelin and leptin — are responsible for signalling to the body that it is hungry or full. Some people are born with a tendency to permanently feel hungry or rarely feel full, and this can impact their ability to gain or lose weight. Close’s best advice in this instance is to plan your day and rely on an eating schedule more than your body’s signals for monitoring food intake.</p>
<p><strong>Myth: “Carbs are what make you gain weight.”<br />
Truth: Carbohydrates fuel activity needs.</strong><br />
Many decry the value of carbohydrates, claiming this macronutrient is the cause of all weight gain. Carbohydrates are actually extremely useful for fueling our body’s activity needs, but should be eaten in accordance with a planned physical activity schedule.</p>
<p>“Let the demands of your day dictate your energy intake,” Close said, adding that for the England Rugby team, he has planned out a weekly chart indicating when players should consume more carbohydrates. The meal plan is tied to the team’s training sessions, with more carbs scheduled on days of intense training and fewer carbs scheduled on easier training days.</p>
<p><strong>Myth: “Eating red meat is as bad for you as smoking.”<br />
Truth: Scientific studies are inconclusive that eating red meat causes cancer.</strong><br />
Close also discussed the growing concern over consuming red meat. While red meat has been classed as a carcinogen by the World Health Organisation, the studies are not perfect as they don’t isolate correlations to inactivity and other lifestyle elements, Close said. Still, it is always recommended to consume fresh fish, vegan proteins and white meat instead. He ensures the England Rugby team regularly eat a vegan meal to ensure they are ingesting different forms of protein.</p>
<p><strong>Myth: “I don’t need much sleep.”<br />
Truth: Ample sleep is vital to good health. </strong><br />
Close’s strongest advice was to get more sleep. Explaining that society celebrates those who can get a lot achieved with little sleep, he encouraged the attendees to change their thinking on how much sleep they need.<br />
“Lack of sleep is now considered a carcinogen by the World Health Organisation,” he said. “Men getting less than five hours of sleep can experience a significant drop in testosterone and see a reduction of up to 60 per cent of the natural killer cells that attack disease in the body.”</p>
<p>His advice for getting better sleep included taking a hot shower before going to sleep in a cool room, helping to encourage the body’s drop in temperature.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s summer, a time for backyard barbecues and pool parties. With the heat of summer, your skin needs even more attention. Here are some tips on how to keep your skin protected and looking fabulous all summer long.</p>
<p><strong>Exfoliate </strong><br />
— While it’s important to exfoliate any time of year, your skin will certainly need it over the summer as it clogs with sunscreen, sweat and dead skin from dehydration. Exfoliate everywhere, including your face, arms and legs. Try using a soothing body brush to exfoliate your skin and leave it looking refreshed and rejuvenated.</p>
<p><strong>Moisturise </strong><br />
— The hot summer weather zaps your body of moisture, and that includes your skin. You may find that your skin looks a little drier during the summer months. To avoid dullness from dehydration, make sure to keep your skin well hydrated with a nourishing moisturiser. At least once a week apply a super-hydrating face mask and consider treating your eyes at the same time with a cooling gel eye mask to soothe the delicate skin around the eye area. Your skin will thank you!<br />
When you’re heading to the beach or pool, stash a bottle of face mist in your cooler to mist your face and body.</p>
<p><strong>Protect </strong><br />
— Of course any trip to the beach or lounging by the pool requires a high-quality sunscreen. And don’t forget a lip balm with SPF30 to keep that precious pout protected.</p>
<p><strong>Hydrate </strong><br />
— Hydrate your body, as well as your skin. A well-hydrated body keeps skin looking vibrant and leaves you feeling energised, too. The summer heat causes us to perspire more, so drink more water than you do in the winter months. </p>
<p><strong>Cool off </strong><br />
— After a long day at the beach or by the pool, turn down the temperature with a cool shower and you’ll pick up a few added benefits. A cool shower after excess sweating helps to keep the skin clear, decreasing acne breakouts.</p>
<p>Enjoy the summer!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are lucky to be able to enjoy the sun, sea and sand all year long here in the Cayman Islands, but overexposure to water and sun can cause dry, dull looking hair and major fading for colour-treated hair. The following tips will help you keep your hair looking fabulous this summer and all year long.</p>
<p><strong>Use protection </strong><br />
— Put on a hair mask or treatment with sun filters before getting your hair wet at the beach or pool. This will create a protecting barrier between your hair and the elements. And always use a leave in-conditioner before styling.</p>
<p><strong>Cleanse carefully </strong><br />
— Use the right shampoo and conditioner for your hair type and condition. There are a lot of different types of shampoos and conditioners on the market. Make sure to invest in and use salon-professional products and ask your stylist to help you determine which is best for you.</p>
<p><strong>Try a semi-permanent gloss </strong><br />
— A gloss is a service that is done at the salon. It adds shine, protects the hair and locks in colour. It is a great way to extend the life of your colour between services.</p>
<p><strong>Hydrate </strong><br />
— A weekly hydrating mask/deep treatment is essential. This can be done at home or at the salon for a more concentrated treatment. It will help restore shine and moisture to your locks.</p>
<p><strong>Prevent buildup </strong><br />
— Chlorine, salt and hair products can quickly wear out their welcome on your hair and scalp. Use a clarifying shampoo once a month or when you notice buildup (dull looking hair) to really cleanse your hair and scalp. Be careful not to overuse clarifying shampoos because they can also take<br />
out colour.</p>
<p><strong>Cool down </strong><br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finding a brand of high-quality Cabernet Sauvignon that is consistently good every year and costs $20 or less here in the Cayman Islands is difficult. But it’s not impossible.</p>
<p>One of Concha y Toro’s wine lines, Marques de Casa Concha, consistently gets ratings of 90 or above and its typical retail price is $20 here. This is a big, well-structured red wine with rich fruit flavours and a silky texture. It is a wine for red meat, game or strong cheeses. It really is everything a red wine lover can want, without the big price. </p>
<p>So how can Concha y Toro sell a very good Cab for less than other wine producers? Efficiencies of scale is one of the main reasons. Concha y Toro is not only the largest wine producer in Chile, it’s the largest producer of wine in Latin America and one of the largest producers in the world. Although much of the wine Concha y Toro sells falls in the category of premium wine, it produces wines at various quality points. The Marques de Casa Concha line is part of its fine wine collection, a level that offers high quality at a good price point. </p>
<p>Marques de Casa Concha Cabernet Sauvignon is a versatile red wine that is inexpensive enough to drink as a weeknight “house” wine and good enough for a weekend meal. </p>
<p>This month, the value is even better at West Indies Wine Company, where the Marques de Casa Concha Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay are both on sale for a sweet price of CI$16.99.  </p>
<p>You can taste both of these wines plus others at the “Chilean Wines” Somm Series event at West Indies Wine Company on 18 July.  Tickets are available at West Indies Wine Company. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, young Napa Cabernet Sauvignon is a wine pairing on the tasting menu at Blue by Eric Ripert. </p>
<p>This surprises many guests who, having heard the old maxim “red wine with meat, white wine with seafood,” assume that red wine will be sidelined since the menu’s focus is fish. However, while Champagne and white wine dominate the wine pairings at the restaurant, red wine plays an  integral role.</p>
<p>While I am not advocating Bordeaux with oysters, here are some basic guidelines for enjoying red wine with fish.</p>
<p>First, keep in mind acidity, weight, complexity and tannins.</p>
<p>Red wines like Sangiovese (the basis for Chianti) Barbera, Dolcetto, Pinot Noir and Gamay offer high acidity and softer tannins, which allow them to cut through the richness of a dish. Think of a fish you would add a squeeze of lemon to and let the wine do that work instead. These high-acid/low-tannin wines also lessen the perception of salt, bringing out the integrity of good, simple ingredients, and they work beautifully with tart food.</p>
<p>Big, oaky, tannic wines like Cabernet Sauvignon blends, Nebbiolo and Malbec also have a place on the table with fatty fish and seafood like mackerel, monkfish and lobster, all of which help counterbalance the tannins.<br />
Cooking techniques, like charring, grilling and blackening, also help big, tannic red wines pair with seafood, but watch out for adding salt — tannin will accentuate the taste of salt.</p>
<p>Adding sautéed onions or garlic helps make red wines “pop” with riper fruit flavours and melds the oak tannins.</p>
<p>The higher alcohol levels of big red wines are also accentuated by salt and spice and spicy foods do not pair well with tannin and alcohol.</p>
<p>For the collector, aged reds become more delicate, so serve simply prepared dishes and let the wine shine.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that every varietal can be crafted in different styles by the vintner, so just because one Cabernet Sauvignon pairs well with your grilled fish doesn’t mean every Cabernet Sauvignon will pair equally as well. Utilise the impressive number of wine shops for help in learning the different styles. Of course, your taste is personal and perfect to you — drinking a wine you love and enjoy is always the best pairing!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Summertime offers an exciting opportunity to get away and explore new places (or return to your favourites), so I’m sharing some of my top vacationing tips I use while travelling in the summer.</p>
<p>Carry a notebook to jot down information about places you want to return to, or places you have been advised to go like markets, restaurants and speciality shops. There are plenty of reviews online but nothing beats the advice from locals. Write down your top areas of interest and ask the locals which ones they recommend. </p>
<p>Download a weather app, translator app and Google Maps to use offline. This has saved me from hours of driving in the wrong direction. With these apps, you can more easily reach your destinations, which in my case are often markets, restaurants and bars.</p>
<p>Plan to be flexible. Have a few areas of interest that you would like to visit each day so that if anything changes (weather, long lines, etc.) you can head to the next point without delay.</p>
<p>When dining out in a foreign country, language can be restricted to basic words or hand gestures. Be sure to learn how to communicate any food allergies with restaurant staff before ordering from the menu so they can assist you by navigating your choices away from items of concern.</p>
<p>In a reusable bottle filled with clean water, add freshly squeezed lime juice, a pinch of salt and a pinch of sugar as an electrolyte boost.</p>
<p>Enjoy your morning coffee as a chilled option with ice cubes and sugar. To enhance the coffee, add a twist of lemon zest.</p>
<p>Buy some cucumbers, watermelon or coconut  — fruit that packs a lot of added hydration &#8211; at a local market and snack on that.</p>
<p>Prepare summertime salads. Our family favourite is a tomato salad with celery, carrot, chickpeas, cucumber, shaved red onion, garlic, oregano, sea salt, olive oil and fresh basil. But see what’s fresh and available where you are visiting.</p>
<p>Make refreshing fruit salads. Find out what fruits are in season where you are and use them to make a sweet and savoury salad. Try this one: mango, red and yellow bell pepper, red onion, fresh basil and serrano chili pepper, all topped with a dressing of olive oil, salt, a pinch of granulated garlic, honey and apple cider vinegar.</p>
<p>Want to enjoy the outdoors on vacation? Plan for a picnic and head to the local park. Pick up some local market ingredients like hummus, marinated olives, pickled vegetables, fresh breads, cured meats and cheeses.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When taking photos on holiday, we are often lost in the moment and simply don’t spend enough time thinking about what would make an interesting photo. By following these simple strategies, you can significantly improve your holiday/vacation photos.</p>
<p><strong>Do your homework</strong><br />
Research your locations beforehand if you aren’t familiar with them. Look at pictures posted on websites and note the locations and angles you particularly like so you can easily recreate them. Once there, ask the locals for their favourite places — they may recommend some hidden gems that will make for interesting photographs.</p>
<p><strong>Consider the time of day</strong><br />
The quality of light varies throughout the day and lighting is the key parameter that can make or break a photo. Too much light can wash out the colours or create harsh shadows on people and landmarks. Not enough light can leave your photos grainy and dark. To capture the best lighting, try to take pictures in the hour after sunrise or during the golden hour before sunset to capture those soft tones. If you have to take a midday photo, try to shoot with your back to the sun and plan your composition to avoid harsh shadows.</p>
<p><strong>Change Perspective </strong><br />
Sometimes the best picture comes from an alternate angle. Try experimenting by getting low to the ground to add drama and perspective to an otherwise ordinary photo. Get to a high vantage point that shows the vastness of the city or landscape you are visiting.</p>
<p><strong>Take multiple shots</strong><br />
There’s always a chance that things won’t go to plan— a truck driving by, a shadow in the face or a blinking eye. If you take multiple photos, the chances that you will end up with at least one great picture increase significantly.</p>
<p><strong>Get candid shots</strong><br />
Shoot a lot of candid, unposed moments of your friends and family. Try to capture them interacting with the surroundings and each other rather than posing for you. Posed vacation photos are inevitable, but capturing that genuine laugh or expression when your subject isn’t aware the camera is pointed at them will likely end up being among your favourite holiday memories.</p>
<p><strong>Hire a professional photographer </strong><br />
Our holidays typically stand out as some of the best quality time of the year that we spend with our friends and loved ones. Consider hiring a professional photographer to capture at least some of these moments. Hiring a professional not only provides you with better quality images, it also ensures the whole group is in the picture together, including the person who usually serves as the photographer.</p>
<p><strong>Be creative and have fun </strong><br />
It is a holiday, after all!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>COOL SUN PROTECTION</strong><br />
People aren’t born cool; they have to learn cool and the sooner they start in life, the better. Cool for babies and toddlers is mostly in the hands of parents, who might consider their child’s perceived coolness an extravagance. However, when health is an issue, then most parents would agree that nothing is too good for baby. Little Angels sells Babiators, protective sunglasses for kids. Research has shown that young eyes are much more susceptible to sun damage because a child’s lenses can’t filter out UV rays as well. The durable Babiators, which are made for two young age groups, block 100 per cent of UVA and UVB rays and will make your child look cool while wearing them. The best part is that if buyers register their purchase, the manufacturer will send a free replacement if Babiators are lost or broken within a year. Now that’s really cool.</p>

<strong>MAMA’S BOY</strong><br />
No human male wants to be called a “mama’s boy” no matter what a loving mother might think. Canine males, however, have little pride when it comes to such matters and don’t mind being called anything at all, as long as it comes with loving attention. Red’s Emporium sells dog tags, one of which proudly claims the wearer is “Mama’s Boy.” Mama is happy. Rover is happy. Red’s Emporium is happy. It’s the classic win, win, win situation for all.</p>
<p><img src="https://camanabay.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/soaps.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="572" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40931" srcset="http://camanabay.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/soaps.jpg 800w, http://camanabay.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/soaps-255x182.jpg 255w, http://camanabay.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/soaps-768x549.jpg 768w, http://camanabay.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/soaps-610x436.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><br />
<strong>MANLY SOAP</strong><br />
It’s hard for guys to get excited about soap. It’s not that they don’t want to be clean and fresh, it’s just that they don’t want to smell like a fruit basket or flower garden. Bedside Manor now sells Mistral bar soaps for men with manly scents like “sandalwood bamboo,” “teak” and “black amber,” which is a fusion of aromas including amber, black patchouli, citrus and warm woods. These rich-lathering, vegetable-based luxury soaps include moisturising glycerin, replenishing grapeseed oil and antioxidant-rich grape leaf extract. They’re free from parabens, phthalates and alcohol and were tested on men, not animals. Men can smell like men and have healthy skin, too.</p>
<p><img src="https://camanabay.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/skincare.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="528" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40932" srcset="http://camanabay.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/skincare.jpg 800w, http://camanabay.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/skincare-276x182.jpg 276w, http://camanabay.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/skincare-768x507.jpg 768w, http://camanabay.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/skincare-610x403.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><br />
<strong>INTRODUCING DERMALOGICA </strong><br />
Skincare products are like dentists; once you find one you like, you really don’t want to try another one. However, just as dentistry evolves, so too do skincare products, and sometimes, change is good. But luxury skincare products don’t come cheap and if you buy one and your skin rejects it for some reason, then you’re left with a large bottle of product you won’t use. Le Visage’s latest new line of luxury skincare products, Dermalogica, offers introductory variety packs that allow customers to try smaller amounts of several products made for their skin type before investing in full-size products. It’s much easier than trying out a new dentist.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Along with my best friend Eilidh Bridgeman, I run the @Cayman.Foodventure Instagram account in which we document our favourite eats on Grand Cayman, an island known for its excellent culinary options. Recently we both attended the Camana Bay Flavour Tour to learn what is on offer at this event, held every Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>This food tour is not like any regular food tour. You get the chance to try five different eateries within Camana Bay and each week the Flavour Tour team changes up the rotation and the menu, which adds freshness to the event.</p>
<p>We were asked if we had any special dietary needs, as the restaurants will accommodate allergies and dietary preferences such as vegetarianism. </p>
<p>Our meeting point for the evening was at West Indies Wine Company for a guided wine experience. We were given our own CI$5 wine cards that allowed us to taste samples from a selection of 80 red, white or  rosé wines. We decided to taste a red first with a glass of Shiraz, followed by a white — Nobilo Icon Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc. </p>
<p>We enjoyed our glasses of wine with the sun going down and listening to the very talented Danny Loops on the guitar, playing right outside on the Paseo. </p>
<p>The ambiance and mingling with new friends started off what was to be a spectacular evening.</p>
<p>We then strolled over to The Waterfront Urban Diner, where we were greeted with cocktails and a soup appetiser. The Peach Fuzz cocktail was very refreshing and a huge hit with everyone who was a part of the tour. Its ingredients included citrus vodka, white wine, peach purée, cranberry juice and lime, topped with soda. This accompanied a very smooth roasted tomato soup, which was the perfect start to the food portion of our evening. It was made from local tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, olive oil, garlic, basil and parsley.</p>
<p>After the appetiser, our stomachs were awake and ready for more food. We were particularly excited to try what we saw on the menu for the next stop at Abacus — fish tacos. The Cayman Billfish Rundown fishing tournament took place the week of our tour and Abacus took advantage by using locally caught tuna for the taco, caught fresh that day and taken straight from the fishermen at the weigh-in station on the Crescent. You could tell how fresh the tuna was from the taste; it was incredible! The fish tacos were topped with green apple cabbage slaw, local seasoning peppers and scotch bonnet aioli. Our fish taco dish was paired with a lovely wine — Bread and Butter’s Pinot Noir.</p>
<p>Proceeding to The Brooklyn Pizza + Pasta for the main course, we were treated to a roasted lamb shank, which literally fell right off the bone when touched. It was very tender and incredibly delicious. This was served alongside carrot and potato mash and grilled local vegetables and was drizzled with red wine. The lamb shank was paired with the Beringer Founder Estate’s Cabernet Sauvignon from California — a perfect pairing.</p>
<p>Ending on a sweet note is always a great way to top off an evening, and we were lucky enough to do this with the house-made gelato at Gelato &#038; Co. By this point, our stomachs were clearly satisfied — but there’s always room for dessert! We got the option to pick two of the many flavours to enjoy. My choice was the hazelnut bacio and cookie dough, which were both amazing  and really had my taste buds tingling. The employees at Gelato &#038; Co. were so enthusiastic and helpful, telling us what their favourite flavours were and giving us samples to taste.</p>
<p>We loved how the restaurants used local ingredients every chance they got for the Flavour Tour menu. Many of those ingredients were purchased at that morning’s Local Harvest Market in Camana Bay.<br />
We treasured the personal touch from each of the chefs, bartenders and restaurant managers who introduced their dishes and restaurants to the group; they all truly provided a fantastic experience. We will definitely be back!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Christmas will be here before you know it. As of the publication date of this issue of Camana Bay Times, there will be only 173 shopping days until Christmas.</p>
<p>Smart shoppers start early; not only do the early birds get the worm, so to speak, but they can also avoid the Christmas shopping crowds.</p>
<p>All the retail shops in Camana Bay have great gift ideas. One of those shops, 3 Girls &#038; A Kiln on Market Street, sells items made exclusively in the Cayman Islands by local artists and artisans. There are decorative ceramic coasters, plates, bowls and vases; there are ceramic bottle stoppers and mugs and even locally made soaps. There is also the option of a gift certificate for a fun ceramic-making class or a wood-sign-making class. </p>
<p>Christmas, of course, is about more than just gifts; it’s also about decorations. The creative artists at 3 Girls &#038; A Kiln make Christmas ornaments with a Cayman Islands flair, like this snazzy pineapple ornament in the photo above, and sell them all year round. </p>
<p>While these ornaments would hang perfectly from the branch of any Christmas tree, feel free to hang one somewhere else in the home if you’re looking to increase your wealth. Pineapple decorations have become a popular feng shui symbol of good fortune because in the Chinese dialect of Hookien, which is also widely spoken in areas of Southeast Asia, the word for pineapple sounds like the words that mean good fortune is coming. </p>
<p>Happy Christmas shopping!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Summer brings higher temperatures and higher humidity and that big red wine you loved on a breezy January day isn’t going to be as satisfying in July. </p>
<p>You might be able to turn down the air conditioner and enjoy a glass of a California Cabernet Sauvignon or Zinfandel, but chances are those wines won’t pair very well with the summery fare you’re having for dinner.<br />
Luckily, the wine world is full of variety and there are plenty of good options that pair perfectly with summer.</p>
<p>There are three things to look for when buying wines for summer: wines with refreshing acidity, wines that aren’t too alcoholic and wines that can be chilled. The following wines, which are all perfect for summer drinking, can be found at West Indies Wine Company, Big Daddy’s Fine Wines &#038; Spirits and Blackbeard’s Beers Wines Spirits and all cost CI$25 or less. </p>
<p><strong>Whites</strong><br />
White wines are always a good option for summer, but you might want to steer away from the high alcohol, heavily oaked Chardonnays and choose lighter bodied wines. New Zealand Sauvignon Blancs like Nobilo are very popular wines in the Cayman Islands for good reason: They have good acidity and maintain lots of flavour even when chilled to ice cold. </p>
<p>Those looking for a Sauvignon Blanc that is a little more subtle can try ones from California (Justin) or South Africa (Tokara).</p>
<p>For those looking for something different, other good white wine options for the summer include dry Rieslings from Washington state (Kung Fu Girl) or Germany (Urban), Grüner Veltliners from Austria (Loimer), Albariños from Spain (Paco &#038; Lola) or Xarel-lo from Spain (Raventos i Blanc Silencis). For those who like Pinot Grigio, try Masi Masianco, a blend of Pinot Grigio and Verduzzo.</p>
<p><strong>Rosés</strong><br />
The rising popularity of dry rosés has been one of the biggest wine trends over the past few years. Rosés are served chilled, so they’re perfect for summer and because they’re made at least partially with red grapes, they add a fruit dimension not found in white wines, allowing them to pair with a wider variety of foods. For those who prefer the lighter Provence-style of rosé, try AIX or Pétale de Rose.  For a darker and richer rosé that can pair with heartier meals, try Elk Cove Pinot Noir rosé from Oregon, Masi Rosa dei Masi from Italy or Viña Real Rosado from Spain.</p>
<p><strong>Sparkling</strong><br />
When in doubt, go with sparkling wines. They’re served cold, almost always have refreshing acidity and are just fun. The Loire Valley winery De Chanceny in France makes Brut and Brut Rosé sparkling wines using the same method used to make Champagne and both are sold for under $25. Paco &#038; Lola’s Cava from Spain is another excellent summer choice and even the bottle is fun.</p>
<p><strong>Reds</strong><br />
There are those who just want to drink red wines, even when it is 90 degrees outside. If you’re one of these people, or just find yourself craving a red wine over the long summer, try one that can be slightly chilled, like Pinot Noir (Villa Maria from New Zealand or Luc Pirlet Reserve from France). Another medium-bodied red wine that is summer-friendly is Planeta’s Dorilli Cerasuolo di Vittoria Classico, a blend of Nero d’Avola and Frappato from Sicily. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One way to stay cool in Grand Cayman’s summer heat is to take in a flick at Camana Bay Cinema. Although some of this summer’s blockbusters have already come and gone by now, there are a number of other exciting titles opening in July and August.</p>
<p>Fresh from his resurrection in “Avengers: Endgame,” Peter Parker and his superhero alter ego, Spider-Man, are back with a new instalment of the third reboot of the film franchise. Tom Holland, who first appeared as Spider-Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in “Captain America: Civil War,” is also back for his second headlining film. He is joined by Samuel L. Jackson and Cobie Smulders, who reprise their roles as Nick Fury and Maria Hill respectively. This time, Peter and his school friends have their trip to Europe interrupted by the Elementals, four extradimensional villainous humanoids, requiring Spider-Man to join Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) in a battle to save the world. “Spider-Man: Far From Home” opens on 5 July.</p>
<p>Twenty-five years after the release of “The Lion King,” one of the most successful animated films of all time, a photorealistic computer-generated remake of the film with the same name opens on 19 July. The remake follows the same plot as the original, with Simba forced into exile in Africa after his father is betrayed by his uncle. Many of the same songs also appear in the remake, but are performed by different artists, including Beyoncé singing “Circle of Life.”</p>
<p>One of the summer’s — and the year’s — most highly anticipated films is Quentin Tarantino’s revisionist comedy about the 1969 Charles Manson murders, “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.” The film, which opens 26 July, features an all-star cast including Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie, Dakota Fanning, Kurt Russell, Al Pacino and Luke Perry, who died from a stroke shortly after filming. </p>
<p>The Fast and the Furious film franchise continues to roll on even after the death of Paul Walker, who started in six of its first seven films. The new spin-off, “Fast and Furious: Hobbs and Shaw,” opens 2 August and stars Dwayne Johnson as Luke Hobbs and Jason Statham as Deckard Shaw. Though they dislike each other, Hobbs and Shaw have to team up to stop a cyber-genetically enhanced bad guy, played by Idris Elba.</p>
<p>The comedy “Good Boys,” which opens 16 August, is being billed as perhaps the raunchiest pre-teen movie ever and has already earned an “R” rating for crude sexual content, drug and alcohol material, and strong language. When three sixth-grade middle-school students are invited to their first kissing party, but don’t know how to kiss, they use one boy’s father’s drone to try and spy on a teenage couple making out. Things go wrong, leading to series of bad decisions that include accidentally stolen drugs, running from the police and terrifying teenage girls.</p>
<p>Also opening on 16 August is one for the kids: “The Angry Birds Movie 2.” In this computer-animated comedy, King Mudbeard, ruler of the Bad Piggies, plots revenge against the Angry Birds after they devastated his homeland in the battle to reclaim their eggs. However, the Birds and the Pigs have to team up to stop Zeta, a mysterious purple bird, from conquering them all. </p>
<h3>CLASSICS</h3>
<p>The Tuesday night Classics at the Cinema features include “An Officer and a Gentleman,” on 9 July, “Say Anything,” on 16 July and Stanley Kubrick’s 1960 film, “Spartacus,” starring Kirk Douglas and Laurence Olivier, on 23 July. </p>
<p>The following week, Classics goes even farther back to the 1931 Frank Capra film, “The Miracle Woman,” starring Barbara Stanwyck. All Classics at the Cinema features start at 7 p.m. and are screened in the VIP Auditorium. The $20 ticket price includes a free small popcorn.</p>
<h3>KIDS CLUB</h3>
<p>The Saturday morning Kids Club features this month include “Walking with Dinosaurs” on 6 July, “The Ant Bully” on 13 July, “Goodbye Christopher Robin” on 20 July and “Hotel for Dogs” on 27 July. </p>
<p>Among the features next month are “Enchanted” on 10 August and “Free Willy” on 24 August. </p>
<p>Kids Club films start at 10 a.m. and tickets are CI$5.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In most places in the world, summer means fun in the sun, beach days and lots of time outside. While that is true for Grand Cayman most of the year, summer takes on a different meaning. Summer in Cayman means extreme heat, hot and humid air, sporadic rain storms and of course, mosquitoes.</p>
<p>The mosquito proliferation can get particularly bad during summer months. The hot air and sun showers create the perfect atmosphere for mosquito breeding grounds and if you’re outside past sunset, you’d better have a can of OFF! nearby. </p>
<p>If you’re new to Cayman or have yet to experience this, you might be thinking: “No way can it be that bad.” Oh, it’s that bad and it’s definitely getting worse. My mom lives in a canal-front home with a stunning view, but as soon as the sun goes down, mosquitoes swarm. They can smell sweet blood from seemingly miles away and if you’re outside, believe me, they will find you.</p>
<p>You might be thinking, “Summer is hot everywhere! That’s totally normal.”</p>
<p>Not in Cayman.<br />
Here, summer heat is defined by parking your car 20 feet from any store, restaurant or office, and being absolutely covered in sweat by the time you reach where you’re going. Summer heat means at least two showers per day, loads of sunscreen on any patch of visible skin, always carrying a water bottle to remain hydrated and taking a gamble at sitting outside and praying you won’t be eaten alive.</p>
<p>Summer rains are common here and only add to the humidity you experience outside. Girls, don’t bother spending hours on your hair and make-up if you want to have a night out hitting some of those outside/beach bars. You’ll only end the night with frizzy hair and looking as though you just cried with half your make-up smudged off. </p>
<p>Of course, there is always a chance you’ll actually get caught in one of these summer rain showers. They’re usually short, but unpredictable, and instead of cooling things off, they just make it more sticky, wet and hot. That’s how you’ll feel if you get caught in one of these tropical rainfalls.</p>
<p>The key is to stay prepared during the summer by keeping these items handy at all times:</p>
<p>OFF! or your favourite brand of insect repellent<br />
A towel to dry off from either rain or sweat<br />
A change of clothes, also for the above<br />
Spare make-up for girls<br />
Hair clips for girls — trust me on this.<br />
Comfortable shoes that you won’t mind getting wet from puddles<br />
Sunscreen and reusable water bottle<br />
An umbrella </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was recently provided with an opportunity to intern for a week with Dart’s landscape architecture department. As I was new to the idea of landscape architecture as a career path, this internship gave me insight into what it involves and how it impacts people’s daily lives.</p>
<p>Landscape architecture offers the chance to create sustainable and visually pleasing environments to help connect people with their surroundings in this modern age of development and technology.</p>
<p>During the first few days, I worked closely with Jessica Barefoot, who taught me about horticulture and showed me the different ways it is displayed in landscaping. We visited several locations, including the KAABOO site, Kimpton Seafire Resort + Spa and The Ritz-Carlton, Grand Cayman and I saw how different plants are integrated with the infrastructure. </p>
<p>Jessica and I spent time at the West Indian Club garden, where I saw a wide variety of plants and trees. I was given insight into the immense planning and designs that go into making the garden so beautiful. </p>
<p>I learned about the computer software programmes that are currently being used to develop project plans and was given the chance to tinker with them. I also learned that communication is a fundamental part of landscape architecture and I attended various meetings at which exciting future developments were discussed. I was also given tours of several of Dart’s ongoing development projects, including the Cayman International School expansion, the Seven Mile Public Beach project and the new Foster’s Food Fair supermarket. I was surprised to see the amount of planning, creative design, detail and thought that goes into projects of this scale. </p>
<p>This internship made me aware of the dedication and strong work ethic that it takes to work in a landscape architecture career. The people I met during the week were some of the most hardworking, knowledgeable and creative people I have ever met and it was amazing to see how good their communication and collaborative skills were. </p>
<p>I was able to see the great amount of detail and thought that goes into landscaping elements such as pathways, seating areas, plant and tree arrangements and parking areas. After seeing this, I will never look at public spaces in the same way again knowing that someone has placed each object and design there for a specific reason.</p>
<p>Lola Squire is a high school student at Cayman International School.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Caymanians and Canadians enjoy many things in common and one of those things is a love of camping. In Cayman, that happens at Easter, while camping in the cold north wisely happens in the summer months.</p>
<p>And so it was that many summers ago my husband and I took our six kids camping in the Rocky Mountains. Kananaskis in the Alberta Rockies is a piece of paradise and it was wonderful to wake up and gaze at the mountains through the mist of our frozen summer breath. </p>
<p>Our tent was, to put it mildly, stuffed. Eight of us shared about 10 square feet of space with sleeping bags, clothing and many, many shoes. Just roll over in the night and there would be a foot in your face or a little head by your feet. Kids don’t seem to mind this. Parents, on the other hand, do.</p>
<p>My sister, who is a city dweller, is much older than I am. I do not mention this to irritate her, but to suggest that perhaps wisdom doth in fact accompany age. You see, my sister and her husband happened to be camping at the same campground we were, only in a different section. They were “camping” with a group of friends who had trailers. Trailers are nice. They are little homes that you wheel out into the wilderness and then wheel back when you are done enjoying the scenery. We should have tried trailers, but instead, we had a tent full of feet, and many, many shoes. </p>
<p>One day, my sister invited us over for “happy hour.” The prospect of one happy hour in a day of camping with six kids moved my husband and me to tears. Promptly at 3 o’clock we showed up at the circle of trailers on the far side of the campground. In the middle of the site were several picnic tables that had been drawn together and upon which were seated my sister, her husband and friends — happy — just as they promised, enjoying snacks and liquid refreshments. There was paradise in the valley after all.</p>
<p>My husband and I sat down to cocktails and lovely little snacks that each camper had kindly contributed. The kids busied themselves with chips, pop and toasted marshmallows. I was enjoying the fine fare and friendly conversation so much that it was some time before I noticed our 4-year-old twins, cheeks full, crawling around the picnic table.</p>
<p>“What are you chewing?” I casually asked.</p>
<p>“Gum!” came the enthusiastic response. “There’s a whole bunch under this table! Want some?”</p>
<p>Paradise, it seems, has its stickier side. Perhaps paradise is just wherever you are, so long as you settle in with enthusiasm and with vision unclouded by expectations. Trust, therefore, the child to find it.</p>
