								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This year’s Christmas Give initiative will benefit Cayman Food Bank.</em></p>
<p>Last Saturday saw thousands turn out to watch the beloved tradition of Camana Bay’s annual Tree Lighting. As Santa pushed the lever to “on” and the town lit up into a Christmas wonderland, Saint Nick also officially kicked off a busy calendar of holiday events at Camana Bay.</p>
<p>Along with this busy calendar, the season is also launching the start of the Camana Bay Christmas Give, an annual initiative to help the community give back to those in need to help provide a merry Christmas for all.</p>
<p>This year, the Christmas Give benefits Cayman Food Bank, which seeks to end island-wide hunger, malnutrition and poverty. Cayman Food Bank takes a different approach to traditional food banks by freezing perishable foods before distributing them to food pantries throughout the island, thereby minimising food waste.</p>
<p>“We are trying to link two problems we have – immense food waste and people going hungry,” explained Woody Foster, a founding member of Cayman Food Bank and managing director at Foster’s supermarkets, which is heavily involved in the food bank’s work, donating much of the food that is distributed throughout the year. “There’s still a lot more to be done, but it is rewarding to see food being put to use rather than wasted.”</p>
<p>Cayman Food Bank had its ribbon cutting in December 2017, so this Christmas will mark the organisation’s two-year anniversary, Mr. Foster added. However, it has already enjoyed significant growth. “Within the second half of our first year of operations, we were able to coordinate distribution of the food to those in need through food pantries located at churches across the island,” he explained. “We currently have six pantries we donate food to, and we also work with the Needs Assessment Unit.”</p>
<p>Support Cayman Food Bank’s valuable work by attending the Cayman Islands premiere of the much-anticipated sequel, Frozen 2. The film will first show on Grand Cayman this Thursday, 21 November at Camana Bay Cinema, in a special screening starting at 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Tickets are CI$25 or families can take advantage of a family pack of four tickets for CI$80. If ticket buyers bring a non-perishable food donation to the Visitor Centre when collecting their tickets, they will also receive a voucher for a free small popcorn and drink combo. For more details, call +1.345.640.4000.</p>
<p>Stop by the Visitor Centre any time throughout the holiday season to collect a reusable Camana Bay bag. Included with it will be a copy of Cayman Food Bank’s reverse advent calendar, with daily suggestions of food items to donate. If you fill the bag and return it to the Visitor Centre, all food will be sent to the food bank to be distributed.</p>
<p>Other initiatives going on throughout the season include a fun cascading coin race in the cinema lobby, where children (and adults!) can donate spare change, and a Festive Dress Down Day, which sees those who work in Camana Bay dressing in their festive gear in exchange for a donation to the Give.</p>
<p>Also, register the whole family to participate in Cayman Food Bank’s Santa Run on Saturday, 14 December at 6:30 a.m. This jolly jog around the Camana Bay Town Centre is full of festive fun, and proceeds from registration fees benefit the Give. Registration forms are available at the Camana Bay Visitor Centre on Market Street, or online at <a href="https://camanabay.com/holidays/">camanabay.com/holidays</a>.</p>
<p>“We need to raise funds year round, but especially at Christmas time you want to be sure people have food on the table,” Mr. Foster added. “Working with Camana Bay on the Christmas Give is a great way for us to achieve this goal at this time of year.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Camana Bay is pleased to announce that the Farmers &amp; Artisans Market will return during peak harvest season, beginning Wednesday, 30 October. In addition, the shops of Camana Bay will open until 7 p.m. on Wednesdays for late-night shopping.</p>
<p>As a vibrant town centre constantly growing, Camana Bay is a must-visit for international visitors and locals alike. This event, taking place on Wednesdays from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., will allow for 40 local vendors to showcase and sell a mix of their produce, local speciality food items and artisanal and craft products.</p>
<p>You can expect to see familiar farmers and artisans as well as new faces offering items such as handmade soaps and lotions, handcrafted artwork and souvenirs, fresh and colourful crops including mangos, breadfruit, callaloo, ackee, and more at stalls lining the Paseo. With a range of items, there is something for everyone to discover at the Farmers &amp; Artisans Market.</p>
<p>Artist Shilpa Tagalpallewar, who has long been a fixture at Camana Bay’s markets, is grateful for the return of the market during the upcoming holiday season. “As an artist, working at the Camana Bay Artisans Market since its opening allows me to achieve my dreams and showcase my talents and skills through my art,” Ms. Tagalpallewar said. “As an artist [who has worked] in the Cayman Islands for 11 years doing henna tattoos and scenery paintings, the market affords me the opportunity to evolve my [skills] to handicrafts and jewellery.”</p>
<p>Ms. Tagalpallewar said she will be coming back with her same spirit and enthusiasm, showcasing her acrylic paintings, hand-painted wooden plaques laced with motivational quotes and many more handmade souvenirs. “I know many of us artists are extremely excited for the revival of the market and look forward to the many upcoming opportunities to showcase our local art,” she added.</p>
<p>Another artisan who will be returning to the market is Maria Leggatt of Island Girl Crafts, whose craft obsession started back in 2017 after a friend suggested getting a booth at a local Christmas craft fair. She started out making driftwood birthday calendars then added handmade compresses scented with calming scents before showing her support for the plastic-free movement in Cayman by making reusable beeswax food wraps and snack bags. Her latest handiwork consists of recycling cigar boxes and turning them into island-themed treasure chests.</p>
<p>“I’m thrilled for the return of the Farmers &amp; Artisans Market at Camana Bay; there are not a lot of regular venues for local crafters to sell their product,” Ms. Leggatt said. “Camana Bay has such a warm and friendly atmosphere which encourages locals and visitors to come and see what’s going on in the market.”</p>
<p>Camana Bay offers a lively, family-friendly atmosphere and the relaunch of the Farmers &amp; Artisans Market serves to enhance the visitor experience. This ritual event brings hundreds of people to the town every week as visitors pick up special keepsakes to remind them of their island trip. Residents have the added benefit of collecting fresh produce to make a healthy meal at home. Visitors and locals alike can also take the opportunity to stock up on Cayman treasures and support local artisans.</p>
<p>The Wednesday late-night shopping at Camana Bay’s shops will make it easy for patrons to peruse the market, enjoy some evening shopping and then stop for dinner or a movie with the family.</p>
<p>Continuing with the theme of supporting all things local, Wednesdays continue to see foodies come out week after week for a new and fresh dining experience with the popular Flavour Tour, presented by Camana Bay and Market Street Group. The menu incorporates local ingredients bought fresh from that morning’s market. While progressing through the tour’s stops, watch local artists paint live as part of KARoo’s Open Canvas event.</p>
<p>The public is encouraged to come out and enjoy the seasonal market and engage in local experiences at Camana Bay.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Left to Right: Lord Best, Matthew Wight, Managing Director, NCB Group, Tania Knapik, Sales and Marketing Manager, NCB Group, Mike Stroh, Trio Architecture, Stuart Shield, Founder &amp; CEO, International Property Media Group,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>OLEA and Kailani recognized for excellence in Sustainability and Design</strong></p>
<p><strong>October 8th (Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands):</strong> NCB Group and <a href="https://camanabay.com/about/dart-real-estate/">Dart Real Estate</a> were recently honoured at the USA and Americas Property Awards, held at the Fairmont Royal York hotel in Toronto, Canada on October 3rd, 2019. NCB Group’s joint venture with Dart Real Estate, <a href="https://camanabay.com/grand-cayman-living/olea/">OLEA</a>, received a 5-Star Award for Best Sustainable Residential Development, and NCB Group also received the highest accolade for Kailani, a Curio Collection by Hilton Hotel, in the Best New Hotel Construction and Design category.</p>
<p>The 5-Star winners were placed under further examination and just one from each category was named as regional nominee. The regional nominees will go on to compete against other regional winners from Africa, the Middle East, Asia Pacific, UK and the Americas in the ‘World’s Best’ Property Awards hosted in London this December. Both OLEA and Kailani won the regional nominee title and will vie for the coveted International Property Award in their respective categories at this prestigious event.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to have two of our projects receive the Five-Star Award for the Americas and be further nominated for the International Property Award,” states Matthew Wight, Managing Director of NCB Group. “These awards are not only a testament to our commitment to creating quality projects that are innovative and sustainable but also to our country upholding a world-class standard by pioneering innovative and distinctive projects that enhance the welfare and appearance of the Cayman Islands. We are committed to building with Cayman’s future in mind and we are honored to have partners such as Dart Real Estate and Hilton Hotels International, that also embrace these values.”</p>
<p>“Dart is proud to partner with NCB Group on the first for-sale residential community at Camana Bay given NCB’s deserved reputation as the premier residential real estate developer in the Cayman Islands,” said Dart Executive Vice President of Real Estate Development &amp; Operations Justin Howe. “From design to construction, sustainability is woven throughout Dart’s development projects and OLEA stands apart for its focus on sustainable design, connectivity and energy efficiency. Camana Bay’s focus on walkability, renewable energy and native landscaping is also emblematic of this approach. OLEA aligns with our long-term vision for creating communities that enrich lives now and for future generations.”<br />
Both winning projects have broken ground with the first phase of OLEA scheduled for completion in August 2020 and Kailani’s scheduled completion date is November 2021.</p>
<p>The Americas Property Awards are part of the long-established International Property Awards, the world’s richest competition when measured by the value of the projects entered. The Americas Property Awards rank amongst the most prestigious commendations in the residential and commercial property industries, and the award winners’ logo is recognised as a symbol of excellence throughout the global industry.</p>
<p><strong>OLEA</strong></p>
<p>For the first time, Camana Bay welcomes those who want to buy residential property in the 685-acre master-planned, mixed-use town to live in OLEA, a waterfront development of condos, townhomes and duplexes. With energy-efficiency at the core of its design, local architectural firm, TRIO Architecture has created a community that will feature the largest solar array in Cayman and an innovative geothermal cooling system. Additional energy-efficient and sustainable features that contributed to the project’s win include:</p>
<p>&#8211; LED Lighting<br />
&#8211; ICF Construction<br />
&#8211; Water Sense Plumbing Fixtures<br />
&#8211; Irrigation Cisterns<br />
&#8211; Electric Car Charging Stations<br />
&#8211; An Acre of Dedicated Green Space for the Enjoyment of Residents<br />
&#8211; Environmentally Friendly Building Materials<br />
&#8211; Community Herb and Produce Garden<br />
&#8211; On-site Recycling Depots<br />
&#8211; Over 200 specimens of drought-tolerant flora and fauna of which 80% are native to Cayman or the Caribbean (this exceeds LEED compliance)</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The magic of Christmas begins with giving and this holiday season, Camana Bay is helping to brighten Christmas for local families with the Camana Bay Christmas Give.</p>
<p>The Christmas Give is an initiative that began eight years ago as a way for the community to get involved and support various organisations through a variety of activities. This year, Camana Bay has added a few new ways to get involved, with all funds being donated to the Cayman Food Bank, an organisation committed to bringing a solution to hunger.</p>
<p>The easiest way to get in involved is by bringing canned and non-perishable food items to the Visitor Centre in Camana Bay by Friday, Dec. 22. The Cayman Food Bank will distribute the food to local families in need.</p>
<p>For a fun and new way to give back, you can also purchase limited-edition Caymankind Christmas cards with fun sayings such as “Be more festive than Santa playing dominoes with Rudolph” and “Be more festive than two ching chings fighting over a fruit cake.” Purchase a pack of five cards for CI$12 in the Camana Bay Visitor Centre.</p>
<p>The Santa Run is also back this year and happening on Sunday, Dec. 16 starting at 6:30 a.m.  Join the parade of Santas for a jolly jog around Camana Bay for some festive family-friendly fun while also supporting a good cause and getting active! Register at the Camana Bay Visitor Centre and costumes and festive accessories are encouraged.</p>
<p>Next time you head to Camana Bay Cinema, bring your spare change and race it down the  cascading coin stand located in lobby of the cinema.</p>
<p>If you are trying to figure out which Christmas Give initiative best suits you, take Camana Bay’s latest quiz via their blog, titled <a href="https://camanabay.com/blog/whats-philanthropic-giving-style-christmas-season/">What’s Your Philanthropic Giving Style This Christmas Season?</a> Whichever way you choose to give, you will definitely help brighten someone’s holiday season.</p>
<p>For more information on how you can show your support over the holidays, visit the Camana Bay Visitor Centre, located on Market Street or visit <a href="https://camanabay.com/holidays/">camanabay.com/holidays</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Literacy Month focuses on unravelling mysteries through reading.</em></p>
<p>Literacy Month returns to Camana Bay this September to celebrate and encourage a love of reading among youth across the Cayman Islands. This year, the theme focuses on mysteries, covering everything from the 1890s classic series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes to local favourite Pedro and The Treasure Map, by Erin Connelly.</p>
<p>In partnership with Books &amp; Books and LIFE, Camana Bay has prepared a full calendar of special reading moments to excite and engage children of any age as they return to school and reconnect with reading.</p>
<p>From Saturday, Sept. 1, come out to the Town Centre to take a photo with Camana Bay’s giant READ sign, located on the Paseo next to Books &amp; Books. Post these selfies with the hashtag #CamanaBay to be entered into a draw for a CI$50 Camana Bay Gift Card.</p>
<p>Then step into Books &amp; Books or the Camana Bay Visitor Centre to collect your scavenger hunt map and get sleuthing like Sherlock Holmes. Hidden in the grounds around the Town Centre are eight book titles. Find each of the eight and jot down the circled letter in each title to collect the eight letters you need to unscramble to form the anagram answer. Completed maps can be returned to Books &amp; Books in exchange for 10% off your next purchase.</p>
<p>Make a date in your calendar to stop in on special Saturday Story Time sessions at the bookstore. Held at 10:30 a.m. each Saturday, these Story Times will feature a roster of local authors. The popular Tuesday morning Story Times in Camana Bay Cinema at 11 a.m. will also be themed, as the hosts read various mystery stories to little ones.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to start entering now for the chance for your child to win a great prize that will make this holiday season even more special. Books &amp; Books is running its advent calendar contest again this year, and entries are accepted through September and October. Every day in December a child’s name will be drawn and they will get to open a door on the advent calendar to find a special Christmas gift waiting inside. They can enter for a chance to have their name drawn by completing a form at the bookstore to share what their favourite book is and why.</p>
<p>The love of reading is something that’s easy to take for granted. However, learning to read is something that takes time, and many children want the opportunity to practise their reading more. LIFE is a nonprofit organisation (the name stands for Literacy Is For Everyone) whose mission is to significantly increase literacy levels in the Cayman Islands. One of the programmes LIFE operates in order to achieve this mission is paired reading, where volunteers work with children in Key Phase 1 in Cayman’s public schools to improve their reading by listening to children read aloud and help them with any struggles they encounter as they steadily improve their literacy levels. The organisation is always looking for more volunteers for this programme. If this is something that appeals to you, contact <a href="mailto:volunteer@life.org.ky">volunteer@life.org.ky</a> to register. Camana Bay is proud to support this cause and will donate a set of books to LIFE in celebration of Literacy Month.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is only one month left of summer but there are still plenty of things to do and fun to have at Camana Bay!</p>
<p>If your children are still interested in attending a summer camp, Starfish Village is offering weekdays filled with arts, crafts, field trips, games and more. Shutterbugs interested in learning the art of photography can embark on a photographic tour with the professionals from Picture This Studios. Camps and classes are not just for little ones this summer, as Cayman Music School is offering guitar classes for beginners ages 15 and up!

This Market will be held on both Wednesdays and Saturdays to allow plenty of opportunities for locals to get their fresh produce!

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dart Real Estate and NCB Group have entered a joint venture partnership to develop the first for-sale residential community in Camana Bay, a master-planned mixed-use town on Grand Cayman that celebrated its 10-year anniversary in November, 2017.</p>
<p>The business partnership represents the coming together of two well-respected Cayman Islands real estate companies, known for developing innovative, sustainable and design-focused residential properties.</p>
<p>“This partnership is a demonstration of both organisations’ track record of creating developments that reflect quality construction, sustainability and thoughtful design. We look forward to collaborating with NCB Group to meet the demand for residential offerings in Camana Bay,” said Dart Real Estate President Jackie Doak. “This project is another example of the town centre’s growth as it continues to cater to those who want to live and work in an amenity-rich community that provides connectivity to the world-class Seven Mile Beach.”</p>
<p>“We are excited to partner with Dart Real Estate on this innovative and much-anticipated residential community at Camana Bay,” said Matthew Wight, NCB Group Managing Director. “NCB has been developing homes and communities of distinction for more than 17 years in Grand Cayman and we are committed to building with the Cayman Islands’ future in mind. We are fortunate that Dart Real Estate shares this same commitment and look forward to delivering a successful, quality development to the wider community.”</p>
<p>The residential development will be located south of Camana Bay Town Centre and adjacent to Cayman International School (CIS), which is being expanded to double the capacity for number of students to 1,100 by 2020. “As the Camana Bay community continues to grow with the expansion of CIS, construction of the new Foster’s Food Fair supermarket and a planned five-star resort, a joint venture agreement with NCB Group further diversifies the development of the town centre at this important juncture in Camana Bay’s history with its first for-sale residences,” said Dart Senior Vice President of Development Justin Howe.</p>
<p>The residential development will feature offerings ranging from 1-bedroom condos to 4-bedroom townhouses. Local architectural firm TRIO Architecture has been selected to design the project. The sales campaign is set to launch in the fourth quarter of 2018 and construction of the first phase is expected to begin in the first half of 2019.</p>
<p>Further details regarding the project will be released in the coming months. For the latest news on Cayman Islands property for sale at Camana Bay, visit <a href="https://camanabay.com/contact-us/">camanabay.com</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mixed-use community partners with National Drug Council (NDC); participants educated on standards for selling and serving alcohol.<br />
Employees of several Camana Bay restaurants raised the bar for customer service and responsible serving of alcohol after attending a Training for Intervention Procedures (TIPS) session on Monday, May 28, 2018. NDC Prevention Officer Simon Miller led the session held at Camana Bay, aimed at coaching attendees on the effects of alcohol consumption, and offering training on how to gauge patron behaviour and to choose appropriate responses.<br />
With more than 15 food and beverage outlets, Camana Bay is a popular spot for dining and happy hours. &#8220;It is important to us that Camana Bay remains a safe and enjoyable environment for all of who live, visit and work here, so offering the TIPS training programme to our bars and restaurants is just one initiative that we believe supports these goals,&#8221; explained Linda Podlaski, Vice President of Property Management at Dart Real Estate. &#8220;The work that National Drug Council has done over the years with this programme has been a valuable addition to the hospitality industry in the Cayman Islands and we are delighted to work with the NDC team.&#8221;<br />
Consisting of a training session lasting between three and five hours and a final certification examination, the NDC introduced the training programme to the Cayman Islands 14 years ago.<br />
&#8220;There was then, and now continues to be, a concern with respect to the sale of alcohol to and consumption of alcohol by minors, as well as alcohol-related accidents, injuries and deaths,&#8221; explained Brenda Watson, Programmes Manager at the NDC. &#8220;Also, changing socioeconomic factors have fuelled a demand for services in the hospitality industry &#8211; in particular the number of licensed establishments serving alcoholic beverages.&#8221;<br />
On successful completion of the final examination, attendees receive a three-year internationally recognised certification. &#8220;This helps them to balance outstanding customer service with responsible alcohol sales for their guests,&#8221; explained Ms. Watson.<br />
The NDC has offered training to establishments on both Grand Cayman and Cayman Brac since the inception of the TIPS programme and has two certified TIPS trainers on staff. The overall aim is that participants work to maintain a safe and responsible environment for their customers. &#8220;It is our hope that participants will return to work with an increased sense of confidence, security and professionalism,&#8221; Ms. Watson said.<br />
The NDC works to address increasing community concerns including driving under the influence, underage drinking, incidents of violence under the influence and increased levels of intoxication. Ms. Watson believes acceptable standards for serving and selling alcohol in the Cayman Islands will become &#8220;the norm&#8221; with managers and bartenders of liquor-licensed establishments being TIPS-trained and certified, and ultimately help prevent alcohol-related tragedies.</p>
