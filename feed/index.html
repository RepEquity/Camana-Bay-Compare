								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Shannon Schmidt</p>
<p>While the end of April sees the close of Garden Month, hopefully an appreciation for plants will continue, whether in our gardens or in the spaces we will soon be able to visit again.</p>
<p>Though most Cayman Islands residents are staying home as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic shelter-in-place regulations, out in nature plants that are native to the country and can survive with little care are thriving. One such plant is <em>Lantana involucrate</em>, better known as round leaf sage or bitter sage.</p>
<p>Not only is round leaf sage well suited for Cayman’s climate conditions — including the current dry season — but it also supports biodiversity, which in turn supports the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Supporting biodiversity is one reason Dart nurtures and adds native plants to its landscapes. It has been said that ecosystems, especially terrestrial ecosystems close to the equator, support greater volumes of biodiversity due to their warmer climates. Not only do they provide food, but they can also provide shelter for smaller living creatures like insects, which are important for pollination. Round leaf sage is a great example of a native plant that supports biodiversity, and it can be found on the Natural Loop that starts close to the Festival Green on the east side of the Camana Bay bridge.</p>
<p>Round leaf sage is an upright woody shrub that grows three to five feet in height, with a similar spread. As an evergreen, it holds onto its leaves year-round, shedding them only as it adds new leaves. Another feature of the round leaf sage is that it flowers year-round as well. The white/pinkish/lavender flowers with a yellow throat appear in clusters, giving this shrub a handsome appearance in mixed beds, or even as a hedge. Its leaves emit the scent of sage when crushed, like most other plants in the lantana genus.</p>
<p>Round leaf sage prefers full sun and well-drained, sandy soil, and will flower more profusely given these conditions. Like many other plants in the Camana Bay landscape, round leaf sage is very drought and salt tolerant. Although it will not thrive in coastal flooding situations, it can endure harsh, salty wind.</p>
<p>Native to the American tropics, it is most commonly found on coastal hammocks and in coastal thickets. A member of the Vebenaceae family, an important group of plants to pollinators, it attracts butterflies and other essential pollinators. Its purple fruits are also a food source for many types of birds.</p>
<p>Easily grown from seed, round leaf sage will reward gardeners with many years of low maintenance while supporting the ever-important biodiversity in the Cayman Islands.</p>

<p>Usually a solitary activity, reading is beloved for bringing comfort in times of stress and excitement, injecting new knowledge and a burst of adrenaline as the reader explores new worlds from the comfort of their couch.</p>
<p>In these unusual times, you can still reap the mental health benefits of reading and enjoy the comfort of companionship…even if you are not necessarily living in the same home.</p>
<p><strong>Virtual book club</strong></p>
<p>Have you always wanted to attend a book club? Now is the time!</p>
<p>There are number of book clubs that are taking this time to meet virtually and tackle some of those – often long – “will read some day” lists. Have you heard of Cayman’s own the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Bookends-Book-Club-733246976820486/">Bookends Book Club</a> or the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/lusticlife/events/?ref=page_internal">Lustic Life Book Club</a>?</p>
<p>Grab your closest friends, or even your family members, and get started! Are you having trouble finding a virtual book club that meets your schedule? Start your own!</p>
<p><strong>Virtual story time </strong></p>
<p>Are you missing the younger members of your family from whom you may be separated at this time? Transport younger members of your family to new worlds, while staying connected. Try a video chat story time where you and your niece, nephew, grandchild or sibling can read the same book together, taking it in turns to read to one another or entertaining little ones as you read to them with funny voices and different accents.</p>
<p><strong>Book swap, anyone?</strong></p>
<p>A wise man once said, “I’m not sure if I’ll ever read it…but I need it!” If your local area’s current lockdown regulations allow, participate in a safe book swap with your friends and family by sharing what books you have virtually, and once they select, ensure the book is carefully cleaned and safely dropped off on their porch – then have them do the same for you!</p>
<p>When you’ve both completed your books – have a virtual coffee date and chat about them!</p>
<p><strong>Share the love</strong></p>
<p>Over the past few weeks, I have seen a number of social media threads providing recommendations about the best TV shows and movies to watch – do your friends a favour and share the love! Let your network know what your must-reads and never-read-again books are.</p>
<p><strong>Keep in touch with your booksellers</strong></p>
<p>Check with your local booksellers to see if there are ways you can continue to support them during this time – whether you can purchase a gift certificate to use once shops reopen, or if you simply stay engaged with them on their channels to remind them you are thinking of them. We are in this together!</p>

<p>By Alan Markoff</p>
<p>When it comes to meal planning during a time when we’re asked to stay home as much as possible, think of it as extended camping in a remote location where you can bring your whole refrigerator/freezer. You want to, as much as possible, have all the ingredients you need in your pantry or in your fridge.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>First, you need a stock of the basics: salt, pepper, cooking/salad oils; vinegars, dried herbs and spices (oregano, basil, thyme, garlic powder, onion powder, etc.), condiments (mustards, ketchup, hot sauces, etc.). You probably have many or all of these, but before you head to the supermarket, check to see if you need more.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Next, plan your menus based on a variety of factors including your budget, what you/your family likes to eat and what you can make over a period of at least a week with a declining selection of fresh ingredients. Plan to use fresh, perishable ingredients first and then meals that can use dry goods, frozen ingredients and long-lasting refrigerated ingredients toward the end of your “camping trip.”</p>
<p>Think about dishes that use dry ingredients or long-lasting perishables that can make a variety of meals, like rice, pasta and potatoes. Also stock up on some canned or jarred goods like tuna, corned beef, peanut butter, jams and jellies, and tomatoes, as well as the basics like bread, butter, cheeses, milk, eggs and lunch meats, keeping in mind that sliced salami is going to last a lot longer in the fridge than sliced turkey or roast beef.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Think about dishes that provide lots of leftovers &#8211; soups, chili, marinara sauce or even a whole turkey can feed entire families and still leave leftovers.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Don’t forget about fruit and vegetables. Fresh fruits and vegetables won’t last a long time, so supplement them with frozen varieties and items that will keep for a long time in the fridge – like a bag of lemons, which are not only good and healthy in drinks, but can also be used to add flavour and acidic balance to many dishes.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>These are times when we need some indulgences, so treats are important, too. Fresh fruit is excellent, for as long as it lasts, and popcorn is a good treat and one that can be enjoyed by the whole family while watching a film on Netflix. And don’t forget chocolate. When the coronavirus isolation gets you down, a satisfying piece of chocolate can do wonders for your mood.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Alanna Warwick-Smith</p>
<p>Spring is my favourite time of year. I love the newness of spring and the hope of fresh possibility and change. What I don’t love is spring cleaning.</p>
<p>Spring cleaning is traditionally defined as “a thorough cleaning of a house or room, typically undertaken in the spring.” It’s less of the cleaning that I find perpetual issue with, it is the associated decluttering, which is why I sought out the book, &#8220;The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up,&#8221; by Marie Kondo.</p>
<p>I’d heard of the KonMari method and seen the Netflix series, so I was sceptical about what else there was for me to learn when approaching the small pastel book as a cure-all to my clutter problems. It turns out there were many more things to learn. This small but mighty book breaks down the KonMari method/checklist into the ideal order for your tidying up: clothes, books, papers, komono (or miscellaneous items) and sentimental items.</p>
<p>My biggest takeaways from &#8220;Tidying Up&#8221; were: Start with categories, designate a place for each thing and keep things because you love them — not just because.</p>
<p>The KonMari method is strategic in starting with categories rather than rooms for your tidying process. Everything must be in one place, so yes, you have to bring all of your clothes from every room to one place. Then you decide which items truly “spark joy” in your life. Once that&#8217;s done, everything needs a home — a very simple theory that when practised makes more sense than you’d think. How many knick-knacks and old receipts are sitting on countertops and drawers with no assigned place? When everything has a designated location — there is no longer room for excess clutter.</p>
<p>A wise woman once said, “We are living in a material world and I am a material girl.” You may not agree with Marie Kondo, or Madonna, in full — but that isn’t the point of this experience. &#8220;Tidying Up&#8221; is a lesson in appreciating your things and subsequently through these lessons, the people and experiences in your life. Maybe, just maybe, I will now focus a little less on the material things in life and no one will ever again recommend me for an episode of “Hoarders.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing&#8221; is available at <a href="https://camanabay.com/grand-cayman-shopping/books-books/">Books &amp; Books</a> in Camana Bay.</em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Kristina Maxwell</p>
<p>A virus is a biological agent that gets into the cells of a host and then multiplies. Some people are more susceptible to viruses than others. Typically, very young people, the elderly, and those with compromised immune systems (for example, people who have undergone chemotherapy and/or radiation, have used steroids for a prolonged period for various conditions, etc.) are most susceptible to fall ill with a virus. However, viruses can affect even healthy young adults, especially if their bodies are run down or lacking in key nutrients. A strong immune system can help combat the effects of a virus.</p>
<p>The immune system is basically an internal army of cells, systems and structures that help to combat diseases. A healthy immune system will sense a foreign substance and mobilise to rid the body of it. So, what can you do to give your immune system the best fighting chance possible?</p>
<p>The following are a few ways that you can naturally strengthen your immune system:</p>
<p><strong>Decrease stress</strong> — Chronic stress increases the hormone cortisol in the body. Cortisol directly interferes with the ability of white blood cells (the soldiers of the immune system) to receive signals from the body and reproduce. To keep your stress in check, try getting some exercise, get more sleep and do some meditation or deep breathing.</p>
<p><strong>Take vitamins</strong> — Though getting vitamins through natural food sources is always the best way, a multivitamin is a good way to make sure that you are getting appropriate amounts of the vitamins that boost the immune system. The big guns for immune boosting are vitamins A, B6, C, D, and E.</p>
<p><strong>Eat more fruits/vegetables</strong> — Vegetables, fruits, seeds, and nuts are rich in vitamins and nutrients. Spinach and citrus fruits are packed with vitamin C. Dark, leafy greens like kale are good for liver function. Mushrooms (though technically fungi) such as turkey tail, shiitake, and tremella are also good for boosting the immune system.</p>
<p><strong>Get outside in the sun</strong> — Getting sunshine is the main way that the body produces vitamin D. Low vitamin D has been shown to be a major factor in many respiratory problems. Even spending just 10 to 15 minutes outside daily will ensure appropriate vitamin D production in the body.</p>

<p>In this time of social distancing and isolation, people are suddenly spending a lot of time at home. For people who are naturally homebodies, this might not be difficult, but people who lead active, social lives are suddenly faced with the dilemma of what to do.</p>
<p>Thank goodness for movies.</p>
<p>Movies are still here for us to cuddle up in front of while we try and find a reprieve from the changes in our social lifestyle. If it weren’t for the Internet and streaming platforms like Netflix, dealing with this pandemic would be harder to deal with. So let&#8217;s pivot from the theatre to the living room, and keep the spirit of film alive with movies we can watch at home with our families and loved ones through this surreal situation.</p>
<p><strong>Streaming</strong><br />
Depending on your subscriptions and technology capabilities, services like Netflix, Amazon, Hula TV can allow you to watch just about any film that was released six or more months ago.</p>
<p>One Oscar-nominated film hitting streaming sites is “Silver Linings Playbook,” starring Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. The film focuses on Cooper’s character, Pat, battling with his personality disorder after a messy divorce. In an effort to right his wrongs, Pat enlists the help of dance teacher Tiffany (Lawrence) to try and impress his wife. This film balances fun and despair so effortlessly that you just might look past the rare non-”Rush Hour” performance of Chris Tucker.</p>
<p>Also now available for streaming is “Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,” starring Gary Oldman. As we wait for the next James Bond, this sleek spy flick should fix you up just fine as its all-star cast of Oldman, Colin Firth, John Hurt, Tom Hardy and Benedict Cumberbatch brings the tensions of Cold War Europe into your living room.</p>
<p><strong>Classics</strong><br />
There is no shortage of top-shelf films on Netflix. “City of God,&#8221; a 2002 film co-directed by Katia Lund and Fernado Meirelles, follows a group of kids in the slums of Brazil as they either maneuver away from crime or succumb to its risky rewards. As they grow into adults, we see just how hard it is to live peacefully in a world that&#8217;s falling apart. Its central message suggests that if we keep those we love close to us, we may come out clean on the other side of adversity. It&#8217;s a message that will not fall on deaf ears in these challenging times.</p>
<p>One movie available through streaming that might seem appropriate to those who find themselves housebound during the coronavirus pandemic is &#8220;Groundhog Day,&#8221; a romantic comedy in which Bill Murray lives the same day over and over until he redeems his selfish ways. Also staring Andie MacDowell, this charming 1993 film evokes laughter and touches the heart, things we could all use a little of right now.</p>
<p>If you want something so insanely goofy that all other topics fall to the wayside, look no further than “Monty Python’s Life of Brian&#8221; on Netflix. More than 40 years after its release, the wacky British comedy group managed to create a story that still has a foothold with today’s hippest of kids. Join Brian, played by Graham Chapman, as he deals with the Roman occupation of Judea and sudden fame as the apparent messiah — though his mother just thinks he&#8217;s &#8220;a very naughty boy.&#8221; Through all the antics, the film crescendos into a musical number that fittingly reminds us to “Always look on the bright side of life.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Alanna Warwick-Smith</p>
<p>Poetry can come in a number of different forms such as sonnets, limericks, or haiku — just to name a few. Some poetry rhymes and has a particular metre, but most serious poetry written today is free verse, which has neither rhyme nor metre.</p>
<p>In times of strife, undue stress or burden in my life, the right poem can feel like a glass of water on a hot summer day. Poetry can provide me comfort through the opportunity to sit with my thoughts and enjoy the simple pleasures of the written word.</p>
<p>While spending a lot of time at home during March, as many of us were as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, I revisited &#8220;Where the Sidewalk Ends&#8221; by Shel Silverstein.</p>
<p>The writer of childhoods and the creator of dreams, Shel Silverstein is most known for &#8220;The Giving Tree,&#8221; published in 1964. However, he was also a celebrated poet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where the Sidewalk Ends&#8221; is a book of poetry described as &#8220;written for all ages.&#8221; While approaching poetry with childlike titles such as &#8220;Dancing Pants&#8221; through his conversational writing style and use of illustration, Silverstein created a compilation of poems that were made for every member of the family to enjoy.</p>
<p>One common aspect of most good poetry is that it is open to interpretation. For me, the poem with which the book shares its name, &#8220;Where the Sidewalk Ends,&#8221; is a love letter to imagination, childhood, and all things idealistic. It is about removing yourself from the rat race of life and going with the flow: &#8220;We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow, and watch where the chalk-white arrows go.” The poem is about taking a step back and visiting a place where anything is possible and “the grass grows soft and white, and there the sun burns crimson bright.”</p>
<p>That is the kind of imaginative writing that brings a smile to my face in these challenging times.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Alan Markoff</p>
<p>It used to be that men who suffered from androgenic alopecia — better known as male-pattern baldness — were the people most concerned with hair loss.</p>
<p>Today it is also becoming more common for women to suffer from androgenic alopecia, although they rarely go bald. Some of the ways women experience hair loss are a gradual thinning at the part line and a general thinning of hair on top of the head.</p>
<p>However, androgenic alopecia is not the only reason for hair loss. Increasing numbers of young men and women, sometimes as young as their teens, are also experiencing hair loss. Although genetic predisposition, hormone imbalance, taking certain medications and health issues can cause hair loss, the reason more people of all ages are are losing their locks, according to Darla Dilbert, the owner of <a href="https://camanabay.com/grand-cayman-shopping/eclipze/">Eclipze Hair Design &amp; Day Spa</a>, can be summed up in one word: lifestyle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the top lifestyle reasons people lose their hair include a poor diet, stress, smoking and the overuse of alcohol,&#8221; she says. Dilbert, who is a certified trichologist — which is a professional who helps people with hair or scalp problems — says there are proven methods to slow down and reduce hair loss, even for guys with male pattern baldness.</p>
<p>&#8220;The majority of men have a genetic predisposition for hair loss at some point in their lives,&#8221; she says. &#8220;However, if they act on it from an early age, they can reduce or delay the hair loss for up to 15 years.&#8221;<br />
For women in particular, hair loss can also be caused by over-processing their hair. Over-processing does not mean over-washing though.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a myth,&#8221; says Dilbert. &#8220;I often advise my clients who are experiencing hair loss to wash their hair and scalp at least one more time per week than they normally do.&#8221;</p>
<p>In general, Dilbert recommends that clients wash their hair at least two to three times a week with products containing salicylic acid, sulphur-rich amino acids and provitamin B5.</p>
<p>&#8220;I also recommend having a residue scalp treatment done at least once or twice a year to remove buildup of various styling aids or other products on your scalp,&#8221; she says. &#8220;This procedure, along with using the recommended shampoos, will help to purify and stimulate the scalp’s hair follicles for growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Something else that will help is a head/scalp massage of five to 15 minutes once to twice a week, Dilbert says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Receiving a head/scalp massage releases dead skin and improves the blood circulation to your hair follicles,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Once the scalp hair is nourished, your hair is much less likely to fall out prematurely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dilbert says it is normal for people to shed between 50 to 100 hairs every day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything more than this is a sign of something else going on and affecting the hair growth cycle,&#8221; she says. &#8220;This indicates that it is time to seek out medical help or a tricholoigst. When someone who is experiencing accelerated hair loss comes to us, we usually recommend a consultation first to try to identify possible causes before we make any other recommendations.&#8221;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Dylan Benoit</p>
<p>In the not-so-distant past, the world was full of specialists; people who dedicated their lives to understanding and mastering a single skill set.</p>
<p>These masters were then sought after for their depth of knowledge and the exceptional products they offered. The baker sold bread still warm from the oven, the fisherman sold fish fresh from the sea, the farmer had ripe fruit and vegetables at the peak of the season and the butcher expertly cut, stuffed, prepared and packaged meats.</p>
<p>In Europe, Asia and many other parts of the world this is still the case. However, the fast-paced North American lifestyle is that of quick-service and convenience-above-all-else. Most of the skilled craftsmen and women have been pushed aside, replaced by industrial conglomerates supplying<strong> </strong>cookie-cutter, big-box stores with cheaper products of inferior quality.</p>
<p>Luckily, when it comes to our diet, the collective subconscious is yearning for a better understanding of where our food comes from. We all want to feel good about what we eat, and we want it to taste incredible. We want to know not only that our food is nutritious, but also that it’s not damaging the planet. We want to eat locally and seasonally; we want to get to know our farmers, fishermen and our butcher. It’s imperative to know that the products we consume are ethically grown, raised and sourced.</p>
<p>For myself, a chef of nearly two decades, these topics are of the utmost importance. I want to ensure the meals I serve to my guests are of unparalleled quality and my success relies entirely on their trust and satisfaction. The food industry is shrouded in smoke and mirrors and with this column I hope to help demystify the jargon as well as share my thoughts and knowledge on various topics surrounding food, trends, techniques and more.</p>
<p>My name is Dylan and I’d like to welcome you to Prime Cuts, a monthly helping of more than just meat and potatoes.</p>
<p><em>Dylan Benoit is the executive chef of Prime Group and the chef partner of <a href="https://camanabay.com/grand-cayman-restaurants/carnivore">Carnivore Premium Meats</a> in Camana Bay. Dylan is also the host of the &#8220;Fire Masters&#8221; television show.</em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Kristina Maxwell</p>
<p>Some people joke that after the age of 30, it takes nothing to hurt oneself. Sleeping can even be an extreme sport that results in numb hands and kinked necks.</p>
<p>However, the average person spends more time at work nowadays than sleeping. Is it possible that your workstation is causing havoc on your body?</p>
<p>Ergonomics is the study of people&#8217;s efficiency in their work environment. An ergonomically correct workstation not only promotes efficiency but can also promote and protect the health of the worker. Common workplace injuries include, but are not limited to, carpal tunnel syndrome, tennis elbow, neck pain and low back pain.</p>
<p>So, how can you make your workstation as efficient as possible?</p>
<ul>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet"><strong>Place commonly used items close to you</strong>.<br />
If you type a lot, put your keyboard close to the edge of your desk. If you use the phone a lot, place it close to you so that you can easily press the speakerphone button or pick up the receiver. Having frequently used items close to you prevents you from having to reach multiple times per day for them and will reduce undue pressure on the spine.</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet"><strong>Use a document holder.</strong><br />
For each degree that the neck is flexed (bent down or forward), the pressure on the spinal discs increases exponentially. Clipping or propping reading material on a document holder allows you to have the necessary paperwork close enough for use but allows you to keep your head and neck erect.</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet"><strong>Sit all the way back in your chair.</strong><br />
Take advantage of the support your office chair gives. When you sit all the way back, even an ergonomically incorrect chair will partially support the spinal curves. Not sitting all the way back either causes the buttocks to slide forward or slumping to result as fatigue sets in.</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet"><strong>Take frequent breaks.</strong><br />
Even the best workstation will not produce eight to 12 hours of comfort and injury prevention. The human body is designed for movement, not static positions. Take a break from your desk every two hours at the very least to move and stretch.</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet"><strong>Get a work space assessment.</strong><br />
Most physical therapists (physiotherapists) are trained to evaluate work space furnishings, tools and tasks in relation to the worker. An assessment will identify any risk factors for injury. The therapist will then assist you in making immediate changes or recommend changes and necessary equipment.</li>
</ul>
<p>To find out more about how to achieve your rehabilitation goals, contact a healthcare professional at Align.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Shannon Schmidt</p>
<p>A bizarre, yet eye-catching, plant found in the Camana Bay landscape is the desert rose, or <em>Adenium obesum.</em></p>
<p>When this plant is not flowering, your eye may pass straight over it because of its short stature and its common tropical appearance. At a closer look though, the desert rose has some uncommon and notable characteristics, like its swollen trunk and root system, which is indicative of a caudiciform. Caudiciforms are specialised plants which can swell and contract to store water during periods of drought.</p>
<p>Native to sub-Saharan Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and the island of Socotra in the Indian Ocean, the desert rose can thrive in dry climates or in tropical climates that have a dry season as long as the minimum temperature does not go lower than 50 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>Contrary to its common name, the desert rose is not actually a rose. In fact, it is in a completely different family than a true rose. Instead, it is part of the Apocynaceae family — which is largely identifiable by a milky sap that exudes when pruned or leaves are removed — and is also referred to as the Dogbane family because it is rumoured to have been used to poison wild dogs with its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested.</p>
<p>One very impressive feature of the desert rose is that it can and will flower at a very young age given the right conditions. These plants prefer full, bright sun and must have a well-draining soil because they are highly susceptible to root rot. Because of this, these plants perform well growing in a pot the same size as their root ball, making them popular as bonsai specimens.</p>
<p>In the right conditions, the desert rose can bloom year round. In the summer months, it can be watered regularly and weekly fertilising at half rate is recommended.</p>
<p>During the winter months, to mimic its native habitat, the desert rose should be watered sparingly. Some claim that depriving it almost completely of water will produce better flowering; however, this may also open the plant up to undue stress and attract pests and disease.</p>
<p>For a great specimen plant, give it attention — but not too much — and you will be rewarded with its beautiful red, pink or white flowers.</p>

<p>The month of March has long been synonymous with the colour green and everyone’s favourite Irish holiday, St. Patrick&#8217;s Day.</p>
<p>But beyond the leprechauns, shamrocks and liberal sprinkling of green food colouring, the third month of the year offers an opportunity to embrace green in a different, more environmentally friendly way.</p>
<p>Eating and drinking are daily requirements for all of us, meaning small changes can have a larger impact in an economy of scale. Local retailers and restaurants alike have an opportunity to champion &#8220;green&#8221; choices as we have seen with the power and popularity of &#8220;No Plastic Straw&#8221; campaigns across Grand Cayman and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>In turn, the reusable straw industry has ballooned and the breadth of products available means there is a reusable straw for everything from coffee to cocktails. Silicone tips, collapsible designs and fashionable cases have improved on the original models, making the switch to reusable straws more enjoyable and more doable in everyone’s day-to-day life.</p>
<p>Another simple swap that is both stylish and sustainable is the reusable, insulated drinking bottle. With the added bonus of keeping your beverage of choice cold for up to 24 hours, brands like Corkcicle are raising the stakes on drinking bottles of old. From insulated Champagne flutes to flip-top Sport Canteens with built-in straws, the disposable plastic drinking vessel can easily be relegated to the past. Factor in trendy colours and psychedelic patterns and this green upgrade is both fashionable and functional.</p>
<p>As beverage trends change quickly and eco-conscious movements sweep the globe, lunching trends are anxious to keep pace. Sustainable lunchtime cutlery used to mean camping-oriented plastic &#8220;sporks&#8221; or pinching your best dinner flatware, both of which inevitably found their way to the dirtiest corners of your handbag or briefcase. Like the reusable straw industry, reusable cutlery is seeing growth in popularity and innovation alike. Joseph &amp; Joseph’s Go Eat cutlery set features a restaurant-quality fork, spoon and serrated knife that bundle into a compact, silicone carrying case to keep food residue in and mystery purse fuzzies out. Reusable snack bags like those from Itzy Ritzy, Trudeau’s stylish lunch containers with lids that can’t be lost and Corkcicle’s new insulated lunch bags that look more couture than cooler bag, are all examples of greener choices that don’t require compromising.</p>
<p>Greener lifestyle choices don’t have to be complicated or expensive and they don’t require you to forgo fashion in favour of function. Invest in a tool or product you look forward to using every day and your eco-friendly efforts will never feel like a chore.</p>

<p>One of the most surprising and satisfying film trends of the late 2010s was the advent of established comedy actors turning on a dime to write and direct horror films — great<em> </em>horror films at that. Jordan Peele with “Get Out” and “Us,” and John Krasinsky with “A Quiet Place,” have redefined their careers with these films.  Krasinsky continues to trade laughs for screams in the new decade with the second instalment of his post-apocalyptic monster story. Starring Emily Blunt and Cillian Murphy,  “A Quiet Place Part II&#8221; opens at <a href="https://camanabay.com/things-to-do-grand-cayman/movies/">Camana Bay Cinema</a> on 20 March.</p>
<p>Disney continues its live action adaptations of previously animated films and it&#8217;s been a mixed bag so far. 2017’s “Beauty and the Beast” was received well, but others such as last year’s “Dumbo” and “The Lion King” failed to impress critics. After watching the trailer for “Mulan&#8221; however, you may ask why they didn’t make a live-action version sooner. The story of a Chinese maiden who enlists herself in the military disguised as a man to defend her homeland against invaders premieres 27 March.</p>
<p><strong>Kids Club</strong><br />
Before Brad Bird became one of Pixar’s best directors, he made one of the &#8217;90s&#8217; best animated features for Warner Bros. Starring Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick Jr., Vin Diesel and Cloris Leachman, “The Iron Giant” is a story about a  boy who befriends a 15-metre-tall metal robot alien in 1950s New England. The film serves as a vessel for more mature themes such as the nature of having a soul. See it on 14 March.</p>
<p><strong>Classics</strong><br />
If you are a fan of mobster films and are still bummed out that “The Irishman” didn’t get any Oscars this year, Classics at The Cinema gives you a chance to see another great gangster movie, the genre-defying masterpiece &#8220;The Godfather,&#8221; while celebrating St. Patrick&#8217;s Day at the same time.  Your chance to once again see the “The Godfather” on the big screen happens with a single showing on 17 March.</p>
<p>To close out the month, Bruce Lee’s final film, “Enter the Dragon,” will play on 31 March.</p>
<p><strong>Culture at the Cinema</strong><br />
It&#8217;s not easy trying to make it in show biz and if you do make it, can you stay there with your sanity intact? Noël Coward’s play, “Present Laughter,” deals with a professional comedian juggling his life while on an overseas tour. Filmed live at the Old Vic Theatre in London and rebroadcast as part of the National Theatre Live programming, it screens at Camana Bay Cinema on 21 March.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Alan Markoff</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a new shop in Camana Bay that caters to resident or visiting women who enjoy the finer things of life in a resort setting.</p>
<p>Riviera is a lifestyle boutique that focuses on resort wear, says Ian Dawson-James, who owns the shop along with his wife Catherine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Resort wear is very specific and is not regular apparel,&#8221; Dawson-James says. &#8220;The fabrics are often natural materials that are highly breathable, quick-drying, easy to wear and easy to pack for travelling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of the pieces can be worn in many different ways, allowing multiple looks from the same garment, he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;For example, they can be worn casually for lunch or dressed up for dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Riviera&#8217;s fashions are comfortable to wear while travelling or at the beach bar and look good in either setting, Dawson-James says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Elegance is timeless and the quality of the fabrics, the superior fit and stunning designs are the best of the best,&#8221; he says. &#8220;These are statement pieces that will give years of enjoyment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Riviera is located on the Camana Bay Paseo adjoining Sand Angels, another shop owned by the Dawson-Jameses that focuses on swimwear.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Sand Angels, we were limited on space and not able to fulfil our desire for a world-class resort wear offering,&#8221; Dawson-James says. &#8220;We felt that we could satisfy this so much better with a dedicated retail concept. Both boutiques complement each other so well and are a natural fit together.&#8221;</p>
<p>The collections at Riviera include those from designers such as Melissa Odabash, Heidi Klein, Camilla and FARM.</p>
<p>&#8220;We also have beautiful accessories and, in many cases, coordinating swimwear available at Sand Angels,&#8221; says Dawson-James.</p>
<p>In addition to Riviera and Sand Angels, Ian and Catherine&#8217;s Sand Angels Inc. also owns three other shops in Camana Bay — <a href="https://camanabay.com/grand-cayman-shopping/forever-summer">Forever Summer</a>, <a href="https://camanabay.com/grand-cayman-shopping/little-angels/">Little Angels</a> and <a href="https://camanabay.com/grand-cayman-shopping/activangels/">Activ Angels</a>.</p>
<p>Dawson-James says Camana Bay complements the shops perfectly.</p>
<p>&#8220;For us it is all about quality, integrity and commitment,&#8221; he says. &#8220;In everything we do we strive to provide the best experience, the best offering and the best customer satisfaction.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Sand Angels brand may not always be limited to Camana Bay, however.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are told time and time again by our customers, from all around the world, that we should take our brand internationally,&#8221; Dawson-James says. &#8220;I could see us being in the most desirable locations around the world. Perhaps as we start a new year and a new decade we can start to dream a little bigger.&#8221;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Shannon Schmidt</p>
<p>Perhaps not the flashiest of tropical plants, saltbush is nevertheless a knockout because of its ability to perform well in the conditions of the Caribbean. Although we have the luxury of not using snow shovels or ice scrapers in the Cayman Islands, the sea can be unforgiving on the plant population. Occasional strong winds bearing sea salt from big swells and periods of drought call for wise choices in the landscape and saltbush is an excellent choice on Grand Cayman.</p>
<p>Fabulously salt and drought tolerant, saltbush, or <em>Baccharis dioica,</em> is native to southernmost Florida, the Yucatan Peninsula and the West Indies. Like the mangrove, a key element of the ever-important shoreline habitats, the saltbush has the remarkable ability to grow on the edges of salt-laden standing water and fresh water as well. Also known as &#8220;broombush falsewillow,&#8221; saltbush prefers soggy soils and can be found growing among the mangroves, in and around sand dunes and in hammocks.</p>
<p>A woody, perennial, and evergreen shrub growing upwards to 10 feet, with a spread of 1-3 feet, the saltbush should certainly be given room to grow into its intended space.</p>
<p>Saltbush is a superb addition to any landscape with its clusters of yellow-white flowers that are a major attractant for both bees and butterflies. Its subtle, yet recognisable fragrance is best enjoyed in a full sun location.</p>
<p>Listed as endangered in most of its native habitats, saltbush thrives on Grand Cayman, thanks in part to the efforts of the Dart Nursery after propagating from a plant that was found on Little Cayman. It can be found in landscapes across the Dart portfolio, and can be seen thriving on the Rise in that full sun environment that it craves.</p>

<p>‘A sunny place for shady people” is how Somerset Maugham described the French Riviera a few decades ago. However, it is what one friend said when I told him that I was visiting the Cayman Islands. Indeed, it is quite amazing just how many large legal and accountancy firms have offices on the islands whose population is about 80,000. The Paradise Papers television documentary on financial activities here may well have been what inspired the comment (although the UK government has now made the Cayman authorities supply a beneficial ownership list of investors and people who use the islands for business).</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Alan Markoff</p>
<p>On 26 January, Dr. Charlecia Moore celebrated her one-year anniversary of working at Cayman Dental. However, her first experience at the practice occurred more than a decade ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was still studying in the U.K. and I came home one summer and I said to myself, &#8216;Okay, I know [dentistry] is what I want to do. Let me start getting in some hours,'&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>The first practice to say yes to an observation internship was Cayman Dental, where Charlecia became the first of many mentees of Dr. Thomas Lerikos.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was with us a couple of weeks,&#8221; he says, noting that his young mentee only observed and didn&#8217;t provide any services to patients.</p>
<p>Charlecia went on earn a Bachelor of Science from the Royal Holloway University of London. After that, she enrolled in a doctorate programme in dentistry in Jamaica at the University of West Indies. As part of that programme, she was required to do internships. Cayman Dental, a practice that was established more than 25 years ago, was one of her first calls and &#8220;Dr. Tom&#8221; gladly agreed.</p>
<p>After spending the better part of two months interning at Cayman Dental, where she assisted Dr. Tom, Charlecia went on to internships at other Grand Cayman dental practices. However, in the years since her first summer internship, she had developed a special bond with her first mentor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every time when she came back from school at Christmastime, she&#8217;d stop in and we&#8217;d have a chitchat,&#8221; says Dr. Tom. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had a relationship going for a long time.&#8221;</p>
<p>A year ago last month, the relationship that started with a young university student led to Dr. Charlecia Moore&#8217;s joining Cayman Dental as a dental surgeon.</p>
<p><strong>A career path</strong><br />
Charlecia&#8217;s interest in becoming a dentist started when she was much younger making regular visits to an orthodontic clinic when she was a student at St. Ignatius Catholic School.</p>
<p>&#8220;I originally set out to do orthodontics and then when I got into school I decided to stick to general dentistry,&#8221; she says. &#8220;But I knew from way back when that&#8217;s what I wanted to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once she developed her relationship with Cayman Dental, there was the idea that Charlecia could join the practice if she completed dentistry school and wanted to come on board.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was the plan, if it worked out, but there&#8217;s a million things that can happen,&#8221; Dr. Tom says.</p>
<p>Something did happen.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was in Jamaica for five years and as it turns out, she did meet a nice young man,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Charlecia admits there was a time when she didn&#8217;t know what she&#8217;d do, but in the end, it all went as planned. Charlecia came back to Grand Cayman and started at Cayman Dental, which had moved from the Mirco Centre — now known as Cannon Place — to Camana Bay three years ago, while Charlecia was still in Jamaica.</p>
<p><strong>Demeanour</strong><br />
Dr. Tom is happy to have his first mentee join him at Cayman Dental and he&#8217;s proud that Charlecia is not only a capable dentist technically, but that she also has the kind of demeanour required in the field.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s calm, calm, calm, calm, calm. I can&#8217;t stress that enough,&#8221; he says, adding that part of being a good dentist is being able to project a calm competency to patients, especially when the dentist is young and just out of dental school, like Charlecia.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a perfect environment for Charlecia to learn the &#8220;tricks of the trade&#8221; through experience, something Dr. Tom says is invaluable.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the hardest thing to learn, for me anyway when I just got out of school, was how to position yourself,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Everyone coming out of school knows what to do, but sometimes the hardest part is learning the little tricks you discover along the way.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Of the soil</strong><br />
Having a Caymanian dental surgeon join a local practice is significant in itself, but having a female generational-Caymanian working as a dentist in the Cayman Islands is even more so. Neither Charlecia nor Dr. Tom know of another female Caymanian who has worked in the Cayman Islands as a dentist.</p>
<p>Being a Caymanian brings a comfort level with Caymanian patients.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it helps,&#8221; she says, adding that some patients know her family.</p>
<p>&#8220;One came in and she knew my grandmother,&#8221; Charlecia says. &#8220;She was just over the moon to know that I was here and I was doing this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Tom says he hears many supportive comments about Charlecia joining the practice.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of pride about it with lot of people, in particular, with older Caymanians,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Charlecia says she&#8217;d like to see other young Caymanians follow in her footsteps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something I want to do is go out in the schools and give little pep talks and say, &#8216;Think of other career options.&#8217; Because some people forget that a medical career option or even a dental career is just right at your fingertips. It&#8217;s always going to be in high demand.&#8221;</p>
